# 3D Quadrotor Control System and Motion Planner
### Description
- 3d simulation of a quadrotor drone flying along designated trajectory. The simulator and supporting code was provided by UPenn's Aerial Robotics Course (available on coursera). 



### Controls
- For this project I derived, designed and implemented an attitude and position controller using a PD control loop, ZXY Euler angle rotations, and Newton-Euler equations for non linearized aggressive motion
